	Abstract = {Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine by providing researchers with a unique tool to derive disease-specific stem cells for study. iPSCs can self-renew and can differentiate into many cell types, offering a potentially unlimited source of cells for targeted differentiation into somatic effector cells. Hence, iPSCs are likely to be invaluable for therapeutic applications and disease-related research. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of iPSC generation that has been made with an emphasis on both basic and clinical applications including disease modeling, drug toxicity screening/drug discovery and cell replacement therapy.},

@article{Greenow2012,
	Abstract = {Since the realization that embryonic stem cells are maintained in a pluripotent state through the interplay of a number of key signal transduction pathways, it is becoming increasingly clear that stemness and pluripotency are defined by the complex molecular convergence of these pathways. Perhaps this has most clearly been demonstrated by the capacity to induce pluripotency in differentiated cell types, so termed iPS cells. We are therefore building an understanding of how cells may be maintained in a pluripotent state, and how we may manipulate cells to drive them between committed and pluripotent compartments. However, it is less clear how cells normally pass in and out of the stem cell compartment under normal and diseased physiological states in vivo, and indeed, how important these pathways are in these settings. It is also clear that there is a potential "dark side" to manipulating the stem cell compartment, as deregulation of somatic stem cells is being increasingly implicated in carcinogenesis and the generation of "cancer stem cells." This review explores these relationships, with a particular focus on the role played by key molecular regulators of stemness in tissue repair, and the possibility that a better understanding of this control may open the door to novel repair strategies in vivo. The successful development of such strategies has the potential to replace or augment intervention-based strategies (cell replacement therapies), although it is clear they must be developed with a full understanding of how such approaches might also influence tumorigenesis.},

	Abstract = {Cell therapy and tissue engineering attract increasing attention as a potential approach for cardiac repair. Adult stem cells from autologous origin are a practically safe and appealing source for cell-based regenerative therapies that may hold realistic clinical potential. A plethora of interesting concepts have been introduced aiming at regenerating ischemic myocardium through adult stem cell-based bioartificial cardiac tissue supplements. Yet, current pre-clinical concepts have not reached translational applicability, and successes are only episodic. This review will provide a brief overview of the latest concepts and breakthroughs in the emerging field of cardiac adult stem cell-based tissue engineering, and discuses the challenges that this field needs to overcome to achieve realistic therapeutic translation into the clinical arena.

	Abstract = {Adult neurogenesis, a process of generating functional neurons from adult neural precursors, occurs throughout life in restricted brain regions in mammals. The past decade has witnessed tremendous progress in addressing questions related to almost every aspect of adult neurogenesis in the mammalian brain. Here we review major advances in our understanding of adult mammalian neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb. We highlight emerging principles that have significant implications for stem cell biology, developmental neurobiology, neural plasticity, and disease mechanisms. We also discuss remaining questions related to adult neural stem cells and their niches, underlying regulatory mechanisms, and potential functions of newborn neurons in the adult brain. Building upon the recent progress and aided by new technologies, the adult neurogenesis field is poised to leap forward in the next decade. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Philips2012,
	Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since their isolation and characterization nearly a decade ago, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have become one of the most popular adult stem cell populations for research in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Compared with other stem cell sources, ASCs offer several advantages including an abundant autologous source, minor invasive harvesting (liposuction), significant proliferative capacity in culture and multi-lineage potential. Numerous preclinical studies have been pursued, with early clinical data appearing in the literature. AREAS COVERED: Autologous fat grafting has gained tremendous momentum in clinical practice over the past several years due to its potential applications in trauma and reconstructive surgery. This review focuses on the published clinical and pre-clinical (i.e., animal) data to date using ASCs for soft tissue reconstruction, with particular attention to experimental models and methodologies. Future directions for rendering soft tissue reconstructive therapies more effective are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although standardization of ASC harvesting and processing techniques, as well as long-term results of existing clinical studies, remains to be addressed, the known biological properties of ASCs suggest a potential role in enhancing fat graft retention and facilitating minimally invasive reconstructive treatments. While clinical applications are being reported, well controlled clinical studies are needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy.},

@article{Sanchez-Danes2012,
	Abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) offer an unprecedented opportunity to model human disease in relevant cell types, but it is unclear whether they could successfully model age-related diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we generated iPSC lines from seven patients with idiopathic PD (ID-PD), four patients with familial PD associated to the G2019S mutation in the Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene (LRRK2-PD) and four age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (Ctrl). Over long-time culture, dopaminergic neurons (DAn) differentiated from either ID-PD- or LRRK2-PD-iPSC showed morphological alterations, including reduced numbers of neurites and neurite arborization, as well as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, which were not evident in DAn differentiated from Ctrl-iPSC. Further induction of autophagy and/or inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis greatly exacerbated the DAn morphological alterations, indicating autophagic compromise in DAn from ID-PD- and LRRK2-PD-iPSC, which we demonstrate occurs at the level of autophagosome clearance. Our study provides an iPSC-based in vitro model that captures the patients' genetic complexity and allows investigation of the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD cases in a disease-relevant cell type.},
