abstract = {Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has revolutionized the field of regenerative medicine by providing researchers with a unique tool to derive disease-specific stem cells for study. iPSCs can self-renew and can differentiate into many cell types, offering a potentially unlimited source of cells for targeted differentiation into somatic effector cells. Hence, iPSCs are likely to be invaluable for therapeutic applications and disease-related research. In this review, we summarize the recent progress of iPSC generation that has been made with an emphasis on both basic and clinical applications including disease modeling, drug toxicity screening/drug discovery and cell replacement therapy.},

@article{Greenow2012,
abstract = {Since the realization that embryonic stem cells are maintained in a pluripotent state through the interplay of a number of key signal transduction pathways, it is becoming increasingly clear that stemness and pluripotency are defined by the complex molecular convergence of these pathways. Perhaps this has most clearly been demonstrated by the capacity to induce pluripotency in differentiated cell types, so termed iPS cells. We are therefore building an understanding of how cells may be maintained in a pluripotent state, and how we may manipulate cells to drive them between committed and pluripotent compartments. However, it is less clear how cells normally pass in and out of the stem cell compartment under normal and diseased physiological states in vivo, and indeed, how important these pathways are in these settings. It is also clear that there is a potential "dark side" to manipulating the stem cell compartment, as deregulation of somatic stem cells is being increasingly implicated in carcinogenesis and the generation of "cancer stem cells." This review explores these relationships, with a particular focus on the role played by key molecular regulators of stemness in tissue repair, and the possibility that a better understanding of this control may open the door to novel repair strategies in vivo. The successful development of such strategies has the potential to replace or augment intervention-based strategies (cell replacement therapies), although it is clear they must be developed with a full understanding of how such approaches might also influence tumorigenesis.},

@article{Maherali2007,
abstract = {Ectopic expression of the four transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 is sufficient to confer a pluripotent state upon the fibroblast genome, generating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. It remains unknown if nuclear reprogramming induced by these four factors globally resets epigenetic differences between differentiated and pluripotent cells. Here, using novel selection approaches, we have generated iPS cells from fibroblasts to characterize their epigenetic state. Female iPS cells showed reactivation of a somatically silenced X chromosome and underwent random X inactivation upon differentiation. Genome-wide analysis of two key histone modifications indicated that iPS cells are highly similar to ES cells. Consistent with these observations, iPS cells gave rise to viable high-degree chimeras with contribution to the germline. These data show that transcription factor-induced reprogramming leads to the global reversion of the somatic epigenome into an ES-like state. Our results provide a paradigm for studying the epigenetic modifications that accompany nuclear reprogramming and suggest that abnormal epigenetic reprogramming does not pose a problem for the potential therapeutic applications of iPS cells. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Characterization of pluripotent stem cells is required for the registration of stem cell lines and allows for an impartial and objective comparison of the results obtained when generating multiple lines. It is therefore crucial to establish specific, fast and reliable protocols to detect the hallmarks of pluripotency. Such protocols should include immunocytochemistry (takes 2 d), identification of the three germ layers in in vitro-derived embryoid bodies by immunocytochemistry (immunodetection takes 3 d) and detection of differentiation markers in in vivo-generated teratomas by immunohistochemistry (differentiation marker detection takes 4 d). Standardization of the immunodetection protocols used ensures minimun variations owing to the source, the animal species, the endogenous fluorescence or the inability to collect large amounts of cells, thereby yielding results as fast as possible without loss of quality. This protocol provides a description of all the immunodetection procedures necessary to characterize mouse and human stem cell lines in different circumstances.},

Here we review major advances in our understanding of adult mammalian neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and from the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle, the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb. We highlight emerging principles that have significant implications for stem cell biology, developmental neurobiology, neural plasticity, and disease mechanisms. We also discuss remaining questions related to adult neural stem cells and their niches, underlying regulatory mechanisms, and potential functions of newborn neurons in the adult brain. Building upon the recent progress and aided by new technologies, the adult neurogenesis field is poised to leap forward in the next decade. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Mitsui2003,
abstract = {Embryonic stem (ES) cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of blastocysts grow infinitely while maintaining pluripotency. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) can maintain self-renewal of mouse ES cells through activation of Stat3. However, LIF/Stat3 is dispensable for maintenance of ICM and human ES cells, suggesting that the pathway is not fundamental for pluripotency. In search of a critical factor(s) that underlies pluripotency in both ICM and ES cells, we performed in silico differential display and identified several genes specifically expressed in mouse ES cells and preimplantation embryos. We found that one of them, encoding the homeoprotein Nanog, was capable of maintaining ES cell self-renewal independently of LIF/Stat3. nanog-deficient ICM failed to generate epiblast and only produced parietal endoderm-like cells. nanog-deficient ES cells lost pluripotency and differentiated into extraembryonic endoderm lineage. These data demonstrate that Nanog is a critical factor underlying pluripotency in both ICM and ES cells.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Since their isolation and characterization nearly a decade ago, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) have become one of the most popular adult stem cell populations for research in soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. Compared with other stem cell sources, ASCs offer several advantages including an abundant autologous source, minor invasive harvesting (liposuction), significant proliferative capacity in culture and multi-lineage potential. Numerous preclinical studies have been pursued, with early clinical data appearing in the literature. AREAS COVERED: Autologous fat grafting has gained tremendous momentum in clinical practice over the past several years due to its potential applications in trauma and reconstructive surgery. This review focuses on the published clinical and pre-clinical (i.e., animal) data to date using ASCs for soft tissue reconstruction, with particular attention to experimental models and methodologies. Future directions for rendering soft tissue reconstructive therapies more effective are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Although standardization of ASC harvesting and processing techniques, as well as long-term results of existing clinical studies, remains to be addressed, the known biological properties of ASCs suggest a potential role in enhancing fat graft retention and facilitating minimally invasive reconstructive treatments. While clinical applications are being reported, well controlled clinical studies are needed to demonstrate safety and efficacy.},

Over long-time culture, dopaminergic neurons (DAn) differentiated from either ID-PD- or LRRK2-PD-iPSC showed morphological alterations, including reduced numbers of neurites and neurite arborization, as well as accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, which were not evident in DAn differentiated from Ctrl-iPSC. Further induction of autophagy and/or inhibition of lysosomal proteolysis greatly exacerbated the DAn morphological alterations, indicating autophagic compromise in DAn from ID-PD- and LRRK2-PD-iPSC, which we demonstrate occurs at the level of autophagosome clearance.

We previously reported generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, capable of germline transmission, from mouse somatic cells by transduction of four defined transcription factors. Here, we demonstrate the generation of iPS cells from adult human dermal fibroblasts with the same four factors: Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. Human iPS cells were similar to human embryonic stem (ES) cells in morphology, proliferation, surface antigens, gene expression, epigenetic status of pluripotent cell-specific genes, and telomerase activity. Furthermore, these cells could differentiate into cell types of the three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. These findings demonstrate that iPS cells can be generated from adult human fibroblasts. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic-like state by transfer of nuclear contents into oocytes or by fusion with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Little is known about factors that induce this reprogramming. Here, we demonstrate induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts by introducing four factors, Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, under ES cell culture conditions. Unexpectedly, Nanog was dispensable. These cells, which we designated iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells, exhibit the morphology and growth properties of ES cells and express ES cell marker genes. Subcutaneous transplantation of iPS cells into nude mice resulted in tumors containing a variety of tissues from all three germ layers. Following injection into blastocysts, iPS cells contributed to mouse embryonic development. These data demonstrate that pluripotent stem cells can be directly generated from fibroblast cultures by the addition of only a few defined factors. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
