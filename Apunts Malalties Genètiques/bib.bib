	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The c-Myc transcription factor is a master regulator and integrates cell proliferation, cell growth and metabolism through activating thousands of target genes. Our identification of direct c-Myc target genes by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with pair-end ditag sequencing analysis (ChIP-PET) revealed that nucleotide metabolic genes are enriched among c-Myc targets, but the role of Myc in regulating nucleotide metabolic genes has not been comprehensively delineated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report that the majority of genes in human purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway were induced and directly bound by c-Myc in the P493-6 human Burkitt's lymphoma model cell line. The majority of these genes were also responsive to the ligand-activated Myc-estrogen receptor fusion protein, Myc-ER, in a Myc null rat fibroblast cell line, HO.15 MYC-ER. Furthermore, these targets are also responsive to Myc activation in transgenic mouse livers in vivo. To determine the functional significance of c-Myc regulation of nucleotide metabolism, we sought to determine the effect of loss of function of direct Myc targets inosine monophosphate dehydrogenases (IMPDH1 and IMPDH2) on c-Myc-induced cell growth and proliferation. In this regard, we used a specific IMPDH inhibitor mycophenolic acid (MPA) and found that MPA dramatically inhibits c-Myc-induced P493-6 cell proliferation through S-phase arrest and apoptosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate the direct induction of nucleotide metabolic genes by c-Myc in multiple systems. Our finding of an S-phase arrest in cells with diminished IMPDH activity suggests that nucleotide pool balance is essential for c-Myc's orchestration of DNA replication, such that uncoupling of these two processes create DNA replication stress and apoptosis.},

	Abstract = {The Ser-Thr kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) controls cell growth and metabolism by stimulating glycolysis and synthesis of proteins and lipids. To further understand the central role of mTOR in cell physiology, we used quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify substrates or downstream effectors of the two mTOR complexes. mTOR controlled the phosphorylation of 335 proteins, including CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase). CAD catalyzes the first three steps in de novo pyrimidine synthesis. mTORC1 indirectly phosphorylated CAD-S1859 through S6 kinase (S6K). CAD-S1859 phosphorylation promoted CAD oligomerization and thereby stimulated de novo synthesis of pyrimidines and progression through S phase of the cell cycle in mammalian cells. Thus, mTORC1 also stimulates the synthesis of nucleotides to control cell proliferation.},

@article{Sigoillot2005,
	Abstract = {CAD is a multifunctional protein that initiates and regulates mammalian de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis. The activation of the pathway required for cell proliferation is a consequence of the phosphorylation of CAD Thr-456 by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Although most of the CAD in the cell was cytosolic, cell fractionation and fluorescence microscopy showed that Thr(P)-456 CAD was primarily localized within the nucleus in association with insoluble nuclear substructures, including the nuclear matrix. CAD in resting cells was cytosolic and unphosphorylated. Upon epidermal growth factor stimulation, CAD moved to the nucleus, and Thr-456 was found to be phosphorylated. Mutation of the CAD Thr-456 and inhibitor studies showed that nuclear import is not mediated by MAP kinase phosphorylation. Two fluorescent CAD constructs, NLS-CAD and NES-CAD, were prepared that incorporated strong nuclear import and export signals, respectively. NLS-CAD was exclusively nuclear and extensively phosphorylated. In contrast, NES-CAD was confined to the cytoplasm, and Thr-456 remained unphosphorylated. Although alternative explanations can be envisioned, it is likely that phosphorylation occurs within the nucleus where much of the activated MAP kinase is localized. Trapping CAD in the nucleus had a minimal effect on pyrimidine metabolism. In contrast, when CAD was excluded from the nucleus, the rate of pyrimidine biosynthesis, the nucleotide pools, and the growth rate were reduced by 21, 36, and 60{\%}, respectively. Thus, the nuclear import of CAD appears to promote optimal cell growth. UMP synthase, the bifunctional protein that catalyzes the last two steps in the pathway, was also found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus.},

@article{Hegardt1999,
	Abstract = {Cytosolic and mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) synthases were first recognized as different chemical entities in 1975, when they were purified and characterized by Lane's group. Since then, the two enzymes have been studied extensively, one as a control site of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and the other as an important control site of ketogenesis. This review describes some key developments over the last 25 years that have led to our current understanding of the physiology of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase in the HMG-CoA pathway and in ketogenesis in the liver and small intestine of suckling animals. The enzyme is regulated by two systems: succinylation and desuccinylation in the short term, and transcriptional regulation in the long term. Both control mechanisms are influenced by nutritional and hormonal factors, which explains the incidence of ketogenesis in diabetes and starvation, during intense lipolysis, and in the foetal-neonatal and suckling-weaning transitions. The DNA-binding properties of the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor and other transcription factors on the nuclear-receptor-responsive element of the mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase promoter have revealed how ketogenesis can be regulated by fatty acids. Finally, the expression of mitochondrial HMG-CoA synthase in the gonads and the correction of auxotrophy for mevalonate in cells deficient in cytosolic HMG-CoA synthase suggest that the mitochondrial enzyme may play a role in cholesterogenesis in gonadal and other tissues.},

@article{McGarry2000,
	Abstract = {Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT I) catalyses the initial step of fatty acid import into the mitochondrial matrix, the site of beta-oxidation, and its inhibition by malonyl-CoA is a primary control point for this process. The enzyme exists in at least two isoforms, denoted L-CPT I (liver type) and M-CPT I (skeletal-muscle type), which differ in their kinetic characteristics and tissue distributions. A property apparently unique to L-CPT I is that its sensitivity to malonyl-CoA decreases in vivo with fasting or experimentally induced diabetes. The mechanism of this important regulatory effect is unknown and has aroused much interest. CPT I is an integral outer-membrane protein and displays little activity after removal from the membrane by detergents, precluding direct purification of active protein by conventional means. Here we describe the expression of a 6 x His-tagged rat L-CPT I in Pichia pastoris and purification of the detergent-solubilized enzyme in milligram quantities. Reconstitution of the purified product into a liposomal environment yielded a 200--400-fold increase in enzymic activity and restored malonyl-CoA sensitivity. This is the first time that a CPT I protein has been available for study in a form that is both pure and active. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the reconstituted material with those of L-CPT I as it exists in mitochondria prepared from yeast over-expressing the enzyme and in livers from fed or fasted rats permitted novel insight into several aspects of the enzyme's behaviour. The malonyl-CoA response of the liposomal enzyme was found to be greater when the reconstitution procedure was carried out at 22 degrees C compared with 4 degrees C (IC(50) approximately 11 microM versus 30 microM, respectively). When the sensitivities of L-CPT I in each of the different environments were compared, they were found to decrease in the following order: fed liver{\textgreater}fasted liver approximately liposomes prepared at 22 degrees C approximately P. pastoris mitochondria{\textgreater}liposomes prepared at 4 degrees C. In addition, pre-treatment of L-CPT I liposomes with the membrane-fluidizing reagent benzyl alcohol caused densensitization to the inhibitor. In contrast with the variable response to malonyl-CoA, the liposomal L-CPT I displayed a pH profile and kinetics with regard to the carnitine and acyl-CoA substrates similar to those of the enzyme in fed or fasted liver mitochondria. However, despite a normal sensitivity to malonyl-CoA, L-CPT I in P. pastoris mitochondria displayed aberrant behaviour with regard to each of these other parameters. The kinetic data establish several novel points. First, even after stringent purification procedures in the presence of detergent, recombinant L-CPT I could be reconstituted in active, malonyl-CoA sensitive form. Second, the kinetics of the reconstituted, 6 x His-tagged L-CPT I with regard to substrate and pH responses were similar to what is observed with rat liver mitochondria (whereas in P. pastoris mitochondria the enzyme behaved anomalously), confirming that the purified preparation is a suitable model for studying the functional properties of the enzyme. Third, wide variation in the response to the inhibitor, malonyl-CoA, was observed depending only on the enzyme's membrane environment and independent of interaction with other proteins. In particular, the fluidity of the membrane had a direct influence on this parameter. These observations may help to explain the mechanism of the physiological changes in the properties of L-CPT I that occur in vivo and are consistent with the current topographical model of the enzyme.},

	Abstract = {First conceptualized as a mechanism for the mitochondrial transport of long-chain fatty acids in the early 1960s, the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system has since come to be recognized as a pivotal component of fuel homeostasis. This is by virtue of the unique sensitivity of the outer membrane CPT I to the simple molecule, malonyl-CoA. In addition, both CPT I and the inner membrane enzyme, CPT II, have proved to be loci of inherited defects, some with disastrous consequences. Early efforts using classical approaches to characterize the CPT proteins in terms of structure/function/regulatory relationships gave rise to confusion and protracted debate. By contrast, recent application of molecular biological tools has brought major enlightenment at an exponential pace. Here we review some key developments of the last 20 years that have led to our current understanding of the physiology of the CPT system, the structure of the CPT isoforms, the chromosomal localization of their respective genes, and the identification of mutations in the human population.},

	Abstract = {The presence of elevated circulating triacylglycerol (TG)-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100) levels represents an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease. Triacylglycerol hydrolase catalyzes the mobilization of cytoplasmic TG stores. To test the hypothesis that the enzyme plays a role in the provision of core lipids for the assembly of VLDL, we inhibited the lipase activity in primary rat hepatocytes and analyzed lipid and apoB synthesis and secretion. Inhibition of lipolysis resulted in a dramatic decrease in secretion of TGs. In addition, secretion of cholesteryl ester and phosphatidylcholine was substantially decreased. Analysis of secreted apolipoproteins indicated that apoB-100 secretion was much more sensitive to lipase inhibition than was apoB-48 secretion, perhaps because of the ability of apoB-48 to be secreted as a relatively lipid-poor particle. The results agreed with those obtained with hepatoma cells transfected with triacylglycerol hydrolase cDNA, in which preferential lipidation of apoB-100 was observed. Together, our findings provide evidence that inhibition of intracellular TG hydrolysis significantly decreases apoB-100 secretion and suggest that triacylglycerol hydrolase may be a suitable pharmacological target in efforts to lower plasma lipid levels.},

	Abstract = {The liver is a major site for carbohydrate metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis) and triglyceride synthesis (lipogenesis). In the last decade, increasing evidence has emerged to show that nutrients, in particular, glucose and fatty acids, are able to regulate hepatic gene expression in a transcriptional manner. Indeed, although insulin was long thought to be the major regulator of hepatic gene expression, it is now clear that glucose metabolism rather that glucose itself also contributes substantially to the coordinated regulation of carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in liver. In fact, the recent discovery of the glucose-signaling transcription factor carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) shed some light on the molecular mechanisms by which glycolytic and lipogenic genes are reciprocally regulated by glucose and fatty acids in liver. Here, we will review some of the recent studies that have begun to elucidate the regulation and function of this key transcription factor in liver. Indeed, a better understanding of the mechanisms by which glucose and fatty acids control hepatic gene expression may provide novel insight into the development of new therapeutic strategies for a better management of diseases involving blood glucose and/or disorders of lipid metabolism},

	Abstract = {Since the pathways of glycerolipid biosynthesis were elucidated in the 1950's, considerable knowledge has been gained about the enzymes that catalyze the lipid biosynthetic reactions and the factors that regulate triacylglycerol biosynthesis. In the last few decades, in part due to advances in technology and the wide availability of nucleotide and amino acid sequences, we have made enormous strides in our understanding of these enzymes at the molecular level. In many cases, sequence information obtained from lipid biosynthetic enzymes of prokaryotes and yeast has provided the means to search the genomic and expressed sequence tag databases for mammalian homologs and most of the genes have now been identified. Surprisingly, multiple isoforms appear to catalyze the same chemical reactions, suggesting that each isoform may play a distinct functional role in the pathway of triacylglycerol and phospholipid biosynthesis. This review focuses on the de novo biosynthesis of triacylglycerol in eukaryotic cells, the isoenzymes that are involved, their subcellular locations, how they are regulated, and their putative individual roles in glycerolipid biosynthesis. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the transcriptional effects of PUFA appear to be mediated by eicosanoids, but the PUFA suppression of lipogenic and glycolytic genes is independent of eicosanoid synthesis and appears to involve a nuclear mechanism directly modified by PUFA. With the recent cloning of a fatty acid-activated nuclear factor termed peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) has come the suggestion that PPAR may be the PUFA response factor. However, this review presents several lines of evidence that indicate that the PPAR and PUFA regulation of gene transcription involves separate and independent mechanisms, and the PPAR is not the PUFA response factor.},

These monounsaturated fatty acids are the key components of triglycerides and membrane phospholipids. Studying the regulation of SCD1 is of particular interest since alterations in phospholipids composition have been implicated in a variety of diseases including cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Furthermore, oleic acid, the main product of SCD1 reaction, is the predominant fatty acid of human adipose tissue triacylglycerols, associating SCD1 with the development of obesity and the metabolic syndrome. In light of the key role of SCD1 in general metabolism, it is not surprising to observe a very tight and complex regulation of SCD1 gene expression in response to various parameters including hormonal and nutrient factors. In this review we analyze the anatomy and index the transcription factors that have been characterized to bind the SCD1 promoter. Then we present the current knowledge on how hormones regulate SCD1 expression with a particular interest on the role of insulin and leptin. We also describe how nutrients especially polyunsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates modulate SCD1 gene expression. 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

This review evaluates the latest advances in our understanding of the pivotal role of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 in health and disease.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRECENT FINDINGS: Scd1-deficient mice have reduced lipid synthesis and enhanced lipid oxidation, thermogenesis and insulin sensitivity in various tissues including liver, muscle and adipose tissue due to transcriptional and posttranscriptional effects. These metabolic changes protect Scd1-deficient mice from a variety of dietary, pharmacological and genetic conditions that promote obesity, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 is required to guard against dietary unsaturated fat deficiency, leptin deficiency-induced diabetes, and palmitate-induced lipotoxic insults in muscle and pancreatic beta-cells. Paradoxical observations of increased muscle stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 during obesity, starvation and exercise raise questions as to the role of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 in this tissue. Mice with a liver-specific loss of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, and inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 via antisense or RNA interference, recapitulate only a subset of the phenotypes observed in global Scd1 deficiency, indicating the involvement of multiple tissues.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSUMMARY: Recent studies in humans and animal models have highlighted that modulation of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 activity by dietary intervention or genetic manipulation strongly influences several facets of energy metabolism to affect susceptibility to obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.},

These represent the major monounsaturated fatty acids of membrane phospholipids, triglycerides, wax esters and cholesterol esters. The ratio of saturated to monounsaturated fatty acids affects phospholipid composition and alteration in this ratio has been implicated in a variety of disease states including cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, neurological disease, and cancer. For this reason, the expression of SCD is of physiological significance in both normal and disease states. Several SCD gene isoforms (SCD1, SCD2, SCD3) exist in the mouse and one SCD isoform that is highly homologous to the mouse SCD1 is well characterized in human. The physiological role of each SCD isoform and the reason for having three or more SCD gene isoforms in the rodent genome are currently unknown but could be related the substrate specificities of the isomers and their regulation through tissue-specific expression. The recent studies of asebia mouse strains that have a natural mutation in the SCD1 gene and a mouse model with a targeted disruption of the SCD1 gene have provided clues concerning the role that SCD1 and its endogenous products play in the regulation of metabolism. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Dentin2012,
	Abstract = {Background {\&} Aims: In liver, the glucose-responsive transcription factor ChREBP plays a critical role in converting excess carbohydrates into triglycerides through de novo lipogenesis. Although the importance of ChREBP in glucose sensing and hepatic energy utilization is strongly supported, the mechanism driving its activation in response to glucose in the liver is not fully understood. Indeed, the current model of ChREBP activation, which depends on Serine 196 and Threonine 666 dephosphorylation, phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity, and xylulose 5-phosphate (X5P) as a signaling metabolite, has been challenged. Methods: We inhibited PP2A activity in HepG2 cells through the overexpression of SV40 small t antigen and addressed the importance of ChREBP dephosphorylation on Ser-196 using a phospho-specific antibody. To identify the exact nature of the metabolite signal required for ChREBP activity in liver, we focused on the importance of G6P synthesis in liver cells, through the modulation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway in hepatocytes, and in HepG2 cells using both adenoviral and siRNA approaches. Results: In contrast to the current proposed model, our study reports that PP2A activity is dispensable for ChREBP activation in response to glucose and that dephosphorylation on Ser-196 is not sufficient to promote ChREBP nuclear translocation in the absence of a rise in glucose metabolism. By deciphering the respective roles of G6P and X5P as signaling metabolites, our study reveals that G6P produced by GK, but not X5P, is essential for both ChREBP nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity in response to glucose in liver cells. Conclusions: Altogether, our study, by reporting that G6P is the glucose-signaling metabolite, challenges the PP2A/X5P-dependent model currently described for ChREBP activation in response to glucose in liver. ?? 2011 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

	Abstract = {Carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) is a transcription factor that activates lipogenic genes in liver in response to excess carbohydrate in the diet. ChREBP is regulated in a reciprocal manner by glucose and cAMP. cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A) phosphorylates two physiologically important sites in ChREBP, Ser-196, which is located near nuclear localization signal sequence (NLS), and Thr-666, within the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) site, resulting in inactivation of nuclear translocation of ChREBP and of the DNA-binding activity, respectively. We demonstrate here that crude cytosolic extracts from livers of rats fed a high carbohydrate diet contained protein phosphatase (PPase) activity that dephosphorylated a peptide containing Ser-196, whereas a PPase in the nuclear extract catalyzed dephosphorylation of Ser-568 and Thr-666. All these PPases are activated specifically by xylulose 5-phosphate (Xu5P), but not by other sugar phosphates. Furthermore, addition of Xu5P elevated PPase activity to the level observed in extracts of fed liver cells. These partially purified PPases were characterized as PP2A-AB delta C by immunoblotting with specific antibodies. These results suggest that (ia) Xu5P-dependent PPase is responsible for activation of transcription of the L-type pyruvate kinase gene and lipogenic enzyme genes, and (ii) Xu5P is the glucose signaling compound. Thus, we propose that the same Xu5P-activated PPase controls both acute and long-term regulation of glucose metabolism and fat synthesis.},

	Abstract = {Dissecting the role of insulin in the complex regulation of triglyceride metabolism is necessary for understanding dyslipidemia and steatosis. Liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice show that in the physiological context of feeding, hepatic insulin signaling is not required for the induction of mTORC1, an upstream activator of the lipogenic regulator, SREBP-1c. Feeding induces SREBP-1c mRNA in LIRKO livers, though not to the extent observed in controls. A high fructose diet also partially induces SREBP-1c and lipogenic gene expression in LIRKO livers. Insulin signaling becomes more important in the pathological context of obesity, as knockdown of the insulin receptor in ob/ob mice, a model of Type 2 diabetes, using antisense oligonucleotides, abolishes the induction of SREBP-1c and its targets by obesity and ameliorates steatosis. Thus, insulin-independent signaling pathways can partially compensate for insulin in the induction of SREBP-1c by feeding but the further induction by obesity/Type 2 diabetes is entirely dependent upon insulin. ??2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Glucose and insulin coordinately regulate de novo lipogenesis from glucose in the liver, and insulin activates several transcription factors including SREBP1c and LXR, while those activated by glucose remain unknown. Recently, a carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), which binds to the carbohydrate response element (ChoRE) in the promoter of rat liver type pyruvate kinase (LPK), has been identified. The target genes of ChREBP are involved in glycolysis, lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis. Although the regulation of ChREBP remains unknown in detail, the transactivity of ChREBP is partly regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism. During fasting, protein kinase A and AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylate ChREBP and inactivate its transactivity. During feeding, xylulose-5-phosphate in the hexose monophosphate pathway activates protein phosphatase 2A, which dephosphorylates ChREBP and activates its transactivity. ChREBP controls 50{\%} of hepatic lipogenesis by regulating glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression. In ChREBP (-/-) mice, liver triglyceride content is decreased and liver glycogen content is increased compared to wild-type mice. These results indicate that ChREBP can regulate metabolic gene expression to convert excess carbohydrate into triglyceride rather than glycogen. Furthermore, complete inhibition of ChREBP in ob/ob mice reduces the effects of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, fatty liver, and glucose intolerance. Thus, further clarification of the physiological role of ChREBP may be useful in developing treatments for the metabolic syndrome.},

	Abstract = {Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is the rate- limiting enzyme in the biogenesis of long chain fatty acids. There is a single copy of the gene for acetyl-CoA carboxylase per haploid chromosome set. The gene con tains two promoters whose primary transcripts are differentially spliced resulting in multiple forms of acetyl- CoA carboxylase mRNA. These mRNA species are different in the 5'-untranslated region, but contain the same coding region. Generation of different forms of the mRNA is tissue specific and controlled by physiological conditions. Two promoters contain an extensive array of c/s-elements that perceive changes in the cellular en vironment signalling repression and induction of long chain fatty acid synthesis. The ability of the gene to respond to various lipogenic signals and the presence of the same coding sequence in all acetyl-CoA carboxylase mRNA species suggest that the biosynthesis of fatty acids required for multiple functions in the cells is primarily regulated at the gene level.},

@article{Okar2004,
	Abstract = {The preceding has reviewed and updated the role of the bifunctional enzyme and F-2,6-P2 in the acute response of the cardiac and hepatic metabolic fluxes to blood-borne signals. These were shown to be primarily determined by regulatory serine phosphorylation, albeit in response to different signals, which serves to modulate the K/B of the bifunctional enzyme and thus acutely change cellular F-2,6-P2. Despite the emerging consensus that F-2,6-P2 does not inhibit FDPase-1 in vivo, the primary target of the PFK-2/FDPase-2/F-2,6-P2 system is PFK-1 and the net flux through the F-6-P/F-1,6-P2 cycle. This remains consistent with Fig. 1, at least in spirit. It should be noted that the report of Jin et al. showed no change in gluconeogenic flux during the acute phase (Jin et al., 2003). Even so, it is well known that the liver is a net consumer of glucose in response to re-feeding. Although Jin et al. did not determine glycolytic rates, we can infer an up-regulation from the reported 10-fold increase in hepatic F-2,6-P 2. This implies that net hepatic output was reduced by coordinate up-regulation of GK and PFK-1 by the bifunctional enzyme and the biofactor, respectively, according to the models we propose here. This description signals a significant shift in the paradigm of metabolic regulation by PFK-2/FDPase-2 and F-2,6-P2 in the liver, as opposed to the classical view, where activation of PFK-1 complimented the inhibition of FDPase-1 to drive glycolysis in response to increasing F-2,6-P2. The new paradigm suggests that the F-2,6-P2 activation PFK-1 is coordinated with the PFK-2/FDPase-2 activation of GK to overcome the persistent gluconeogenic flux and acutely reduce net hepatic glucose output. Thus, the newly described activation of GK by PFK-2/FDPase-2 helps to fulfill its moniker, the bifunctional enzyme, at the cellular level because this regulatory system is now seen to function in two ways to up-regulate glycolysis, activation of both GK and PFK-1. At the same time, we have adopted a new perspective of the bifunctional enzyme by making the case that the separation of the active sites, especially the extreme stability of the His-P intermediate at the FDPase-2 site, constitutes a regulatory strategy that imparts switch-like behavior to PFK-2/FDPase-2. This switch-like action is directly related to the linkage of the phosphorylation state of Ser-32 to that of His-258, which provides for acute modulation of cellular F-2,6-P2. Moreover, the same regulatory Ser-P site also impacts the activation of GK by PFK-2/FDPase-2. In this light, the detailed biophysical studies of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the change in the enzyme's K/B in response to de/phosphorylation of Ser-32 gain significance, especially with regard to therapeutic modulation of cellular F-2,6-P2. These are most clearly evident with regard to diabetes (Okar et al., 1998); however, recent observations that reducing F-2,6-P2 in cancer cells can weaken them towards chemotherapeutics (Hirata et al., 2000) suggests that the PFK-2/FDPase-2/F-2,6-P2 system may provide pharmaceutical targets beyond the liver and diabetes. The observation that the hepatic PFK-2/FDPase-2/F-2,6-P2 system works with GK to coordinate the acute up-regulation of glucose phosphorylation and glycolysis implies that the net effect is to commit the incoming sugar to glycolysis and the preferential oxidation of serum glucose by the liver in the fasted-to-fed transition. This is intriguingly consistent with observations by others that liver glycogen is repleted from 3 carbon precursors after re-feeding (McGarry et al., 1987). When considered in the context of the report from Cascante et al. that F-2,6-P 2 can influence the substrate channeling from glucose to trioses (Cascante et al., 2000) and the observations of the existence of macromolecular complexes within the cytosol that bring together the enzymes of glycogen synthesis (Newgard et al., 2000), we are encouraged to suggest that hepatic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis may take place within physically distinct complexes of metabolic enzymes and regulators. The existence of distinct metabolic fates of the G-6-P produced by hexokinase 1 and GK (hexokinase IV) has suggested that the pathways of carbohydrate metabolism may be spatially distinct (Seoane et al., 1996). Although the interpretation of Seoane et al. is based on substrate "pools", we consider these equivalent to our hypothetical macromolecular complexes. In this light, their observations are consistent with distinct complexes for glycolysis and glycogenesis with which HK1 and HK4 (GK) differentially interact. The same is true of the binding to PFK-2/FDPase-2; HK1 apparently, does not bind to the bifunctional enzyme (Baltrusch et al., 2000). We are not the first to ponder such possibilities (Srere et al., 1987; Ureta, 1978), yet we contend that the strength of the recent data and the functional context provided by the in vivo studies of F-2,6-P2 and GK binding, brings new impetus to such considerations (Baltrusch et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2001b). Regardless of whether such subcellular complexes actually exist in the cytosol, the coordinating role of the bifunctional enzyme with regard to activation of PFK-1 (via F-2,6-P 2) and of GK (via protein:protein interaction) described herein is a novel mechanism for the acute response of the liver to re-feeding. From the perspective of molecular switches, the interaction between GK and the bifunctional enzyme brings together two powerful regulators of liver fuel metabolism (Aiston et al., 2001; Matschinsky, 1990; Van Schaftingen et al., 1997), as GK too has substantial switch-like properties, but that discussion is beyond the scope of the current article. The modulation of global lipid metabolism promoted by increased hepatic F-2,6-P2 (Wu et al., 2001b, 2002) may reflect a similar coordinating role for F-2,6-P2 and the bifunctional enzyme isozymes in systemic fuel metabolism. Those discussions, no doubt, shall be the topic of future studies of this enigmatic and powerful regulator of fuel metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), a constitutively acting multi-functional serine threonine kinase is involved in diverse physiological pathways ranging from metabolism, cell cycle, gene expression, development and oncogenesis to neuroprotection. These diverse multiple functions attributed to GSK3 can be explained by variety of substrates like glycogen synthase, tau protein and beta catenin that are phosphorylated leading to their inactivation. GSK3 has been implicated in various diseases such as diabetes, inflammation, cancer, Alzheimer's and bipolar disorder. GSK3 negatively regulates insulin-mediated glycogen synthesis and glucose homeostasis, and increased expression and activity of GSK3 has been reported in type II diabetics and obese animal models. Consequently, inhibitors of GSK3 have been demonstrated to have anti-diabetic effects in vitro and in animal models. However, inhibition of GSK3 poses a challenge as achieving selectivity of an over achieving kinase involved in various pathways with multiple substrates may lead to side effects and toxicity. The primary concern is developing inhibitors of GSK3 that are anti-diabetic but do not lead to up-regulation of oncogenes. The focus of this review is the recent advances and the challenges surrounding GSK3 as an anti-diabetic therapeutic target.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the parenchymal units in the liver of the rat three-dimensionally, 15 micrometer cryosections were used for the demonstration of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) activity to visualize the borders of the individual units. Together with the supplying and draining vessels, they were traced through a sequence of 146 sections and reconstructed. A cone-shaped secondary unit with a height of 2.1 mm and a volume of 3.3 mm3 was reconstructed. It was "covered" by a continuous vascular surface, consisting of portal tracts and vascular septa, connecting the portal venular branches. The secondary unit was subdivided by portal tracts and vascular septa, and by branches of a draining central venular tree into 14 primary units. Most of them were tri- to heptahedral in shape. The height varied between 330 and 840 micrometer, and the volume varied between 0.094 and 0.621 mm3. The branches of the portal venular tree, with diameters from 28 +/- 5 micrometer to 61 +/- 14 micrometer, were oriented preferentially along the vertical axis of the units. Most of the primary units were drained by single branches of the central venular tree, located in the center and oriented along the vertical axis of the units. Vessel diameters ranged from 62 +/- 14 micrometer to 216 +/- 9 micrometer. The average length of the sinusoids was 355 +/- 3 micrometer. From the results of this reconstruction study, it was concluded that the concept of the liver acinus cannot be applied to the liver of the rat.},

	Abstract = {De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is activated in proliferating cells in response to an increased demand for nucleotides needed for DNA synthesis. The pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway in baby hamster kidney cells, synchronized by serum deprivation, was found to be up-regulated 1.9-fold during S phase and subsequently down-regulated as the cells progressed through the cycle. The nucleotide pools were depleted by serum starvation and were not replenished during the first round of cell division, suggesting that the rate of utilization of the newly synthesized nucleotides closely matched their rate of formation. The activation and subsequent down-regulation of the pathway can be attributed to altered allosteric regulation of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity of CAD (carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase-aspartate carbamoyltransferase-dihydroorotase), a multifunctional protein that initiates mammalian pyrimidine biosynthesis. As the culture approached S-phase there was an increased sensitivity to the allosteric activator, 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, and a loss of UTP inhibition, changes that were reversed when cells emerged from S phase. The allosteric regulation of CAD is known to be modulated by MAP kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylations as well as by autophosphorylation. CAD was found to be fully autophosphorylated in the synchronized cells, but the level remained invariant throughout the cycle. Although the MAPK activity increased early in G(1), the phosphorylation of the CAD MAPK site was delayed until just before the onset of S phase, probably due to antagonistic phosphorylation by PKA that persisted until late G(1). Once activated, pyrimidine biosynthesis remained elevated until rephosphorylation of CAD by PKA and dephosphorylation of the CAD MAPK site late in S phase. Thus, the cell cycle-dependent regulation of pyrimidine biosynthesis results from the sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CAD under the control of two important signaling cascades.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND {\&} AIMS: Concentrative nucleoside transporters CNT1 (pyrimidine preferring) and CNT2 (purine preferring) may be involved in the uptake of nucleoside-derived drugs used in antiviral and chemical therapies. The possibility that nucleoside carrier isoform expression is modulated by nutrient availability has been studied. METHODS: CNT1 and CNT2 tissue distribution was determined by Western blot analysis. The effect of 48-hour starvation on CNT expression was then studied. Nucleoside transporter expression and uptake activity were measured in jejunal brush border plasma membrane vesicles from fed and starved rats. The expression of nucleoside transporters was later determined in a second model of nutrient deficiency: rats fed a purified diet with or without nucleotides for 10 days. RESULTS: CNT1 and CNT2 nucleoside transporters were expressed in a wider variety of tissues than expected from messenger RNA distribution analysis. CNT1 was sensitive to nutrient availability in small intestine and, accordingly, jejunal brush border membrane vesicles from 48-hour-fasted rats showed increased expression of CNT1 and enhanced Na(+)-dependent thymidine and gemcitabine uptake. This effect was mimicked by feeding semipurified diets lacking nucleotides. CONCLUSIONS: Substrate availability modulates nucleoside transporter expression (CNT1) in rat jejunum in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Free ammonium ions are produced and consumed during cell metabolism. Glutamine synthetase utilizes free ammonium ions to produce glutamine in the cytosol whereas glutaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase generate free ammonium ions in the mitochondria from glutamine and glutamate, respectively. Ammonia and bicarbonate are condensed in the liver mitochondria to yield carbamoylphosphate initiating the urea cycle, the major mechanism of ammonium removal in humans. Healthy kidney produces ammonium which may be released into the systemic circulation or excreted into the urine depending predominantly on acid-base status, so that metabolic acidosis increases urinary ammonium excretion while metabolic alkalosis induces the opposite effect. Brain and skeletal muscle neither remove nor produce ammonium in normal conditions, but they are able to seize ammonium during hyperammonemia, releasing glutamine. Ammonia in gas phase has been detected in exhaled breath and skin, denoting that these organs may participate in nitrogen elimination. Ammonium homeostasis is profoundly altered in liver failure resulting in hyperammonemia due to the deficient ammonium clearance by the diseased liver and to the development of portal collateral circulation that diverts portal blood with high ammonium content to the systemic blood stream. Although blood ammonium concentration is usually elevated in liver disease, a substantial role of ammonium causing hepatic encephalopathy has not been demonstrated in human clinical studies. Hyperammonemia is also produced in urea cycle disorders and other situations leading to either defective ammonium removal or overproduction of ammonium that overcomes liver clearance capacity. Most diseases resulting in hyperammonemia and cerebral edema are preceded by hyperventilation and respiratory alkalosis of unclear origin that may be caused by the intracellular acidosis occurring in these conditions. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.

The liver shows net glutamine output in metabolic acidosis, in prolonged starvation and animals bearing tumors, net glutamine uptake in the postabsorptive state, on consuming high protein diets, and in uncontrolled diabetes or sepsis. Liver glutamine synthetase is expressed only in a small population of perivenous cells that allows it to salvage any ammonia not incorporated into urea in periportal cells. Hepatic glutaminase is a unique isozyme found only in periportal liver parenchymal cells where it provides glutamate and ammonia for the urea cycle.

	Abstract = {Aralar1 and citrin are members of the subfamily of calcium-binding mitochondrial carriers and correspond to two isoforms of the mitochondrial aspartate/glutamate carrier (AGC). These proteins are activated by Ca2+ acting on the external side of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Although it is known that aralar1 is expressed mainly in skeletal muscle, heart and brain, whereas citrin is present in liver, kidney and heart, the precise tissue distribution of the two proteins in embryonic and adult tissues is largely unknown. We investigated the pattern of expression of aralar1 and citrin in murine embryonic and adult tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. In situ hybridization analysis indicates that both isoforms are expressed strongly in the branchial arches, dermomyotome, limb and tail buds at early embryonic stages. However, citrin was more abundant in the ectodermal components of these structures whereas aralarl had a predominantly mesenchymal localization. The strong expression of citrin in the liver was acquired postnatally, whereas the characteristic expression of aralar1 in skeletal muscle was detected at E18 and that in the heart began early in development (E11) and was preferentially localized to auricular myocardium in late embryonic stages. Aralar1 was also expressed in bone marrow, T-lymphocytes and macrophages, including Kupffer cells in the liver, indicating that this is the major AGC isoform present in the hematopoietic system. Both aralar1 and citrin were expressed in fetal gut and adult stomach, ovary, testis, and pancreas, but only aralar1 is enriched in lung and insulin-secreting beta cells. These results show that aralar1 is expressed in many more tissues than originally believed and is absent from hepatocytes, where citrin is the only AGC isoform present. This explains why citrin deficiency in humans (type II citrullinemia) only affects the liver and suggests that aralar1 may compensate for the lack of citrin in other tissues.},

	Abstract = {The malate-aspartate NADH shuttle in mammalian cells requires the activity of the mitochondrial aspartate-glutamate carrier (AGC). Recently, we identified in man two AGC isoforms, aralar1 and citrin, which are regulated by calcium on the external face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. We have now identified Agc1p as the yeast counterpart of the human AGC. The corresponding gene was overexpressed in bacteria and yeast mitochondria, and the protein was reconstituted in liposomes where it was identified as an aspartate-glutamate transporter from its transport properties. Furthermore, yeast cells lacking Agc1p were unable to grow on acetate and oleic acid, and had reduced levels of valine, ornithine and citrulline; in contrast they grew on ethanol. Expression of the human AGC isoforms can replace the function of Agc1p. However, unlike its human orthologues, yeast Agc1p catalyses both aspartate-glutamate exchange and substrate uniport activities. We conclude that Agc1p performs two metabolic roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On the one hand, it functions as a uniporter to supply the mitochondria with glutamate for nitrogen metabolism and ornithine synthesis. On the other, the Agc1p, as an aspartate-glutamate exchanger, plays a role within the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle which is critical for the growth of yeast on acetate and fatty acids as carbon sources. These results provide strong evidence of the existence of a malate-aspartate NADH shuttle in yeast.},

	Abstract = {The common feature of urea cycle diseases (UCD) is a defect in ammonium elimination in liver, leading to hyperammonemia. This excess of circulating ammonium eventually reaches the central nervous system, where the main toxic effects of ammonium occur. These are reversible or irreversible, depending on the age of onset as well as the duration and the level of ammonium exposure. The brain is much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of ammonium during development than in adulthood, and surviving UCD patients may develop cortical and basal ganglia hypodensities, cortical atrophy, white matter atrophy or hypomyelination and ventricular dilatation. While for a long time, the mechanisms leading to these irreversible effects of ammonium exposure on the brain remained poorly understood, these last few years have brought new data showing in particular that ammonium exposure alters several amino acid pathways and neurotransmitter systems, cerebral energy, nitric oxide synthesis, axonal and dendritic growth, signal transduction pathways, as well as K+ and water channels. All these effects of ammonium on CNS may eventually lead to energy deficit, oxidative stress and cell death. Recent work also proposed neuroprotective strategies, such as the use of NMDA receptor antagonists, nitric oxide inhibitors, creatine and acetyl-l-carnitine, to counteract the toxic effects of ammonium. Better understanding the pathophysiology of ammonium toxicity to the brain under UCD will allow the development of new strategies for neuroprotection. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Increased blood cholesterol is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Cholesterol homeostasis in the body is controlled mainly by endogenous synthesis, intestinal absorption, and hepatic excretion. Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a polytopic transmembrane protein localized at the apical membrane of enterocytes and the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes. It functions as a sterol transporter to mediate intestinal cholesterol absorption and counter-balances hepatobiliary cholesterol excretion. NPC1L1 is the molecular target of ezetimibe, a potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor that is widely used in treating hypercholesterolemia. Recent findings suggest that NPC1L1 deficiency or ezetimibe treatment also prevents diet-induced hepatic steatosis and obesity in addition to reducing blood cholesterol. Future studies should focus on molecular mechanisms underlying NPC1L1-dependent cholesterol transport and elucidation of how a cholesterol transporter modulates the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the role of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) in the resistance of dyslipidemic hamsters to statin-induced LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction and the molecular mechanism by which statins modulated PCSK9 gene expression in vivo. We utilized the fructose diet-induced dyslipidemic hamsters as an in vivo model and rosuvastatin to examine its effects on liver PCSK9 and LDL receptor (LDLR) expression and serum lipid levels. We showed that rosuvastatin induced PCSK9 mRNA to a greater extent than LDLR mRNA in the hamster liver. The net result was that hepatic LDLR protein level was reduced. This correlated closely with an increase in serum LDL-C with statin treatment. More importantly, we demonstrated that in addition to an increase in sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) expression, rosuvastatin treatment increased the liver expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha), the newly identified key transactivator for PCSK9 gene expression. Our study suggests that the inducing effect of rosuvastatin on HNF1alpha is likely a underlying mechanism accounting for the higher induction of PCSK9 than LDLR because of the utilization of two transactivators (HNF1alpha and SREBP2) in PCSK9 transcription versus one (SREBP2) in LDLR transcription. Thus, the net balance is in favor of PCSK9-induced degradation of LDLR in the hamster liver, abrogating the effect of rosuvastatin on LDL-C lowering.},

@article{Perez-Torras2013,
	Abstract = {Nucleoside transporters (NTs) mediate the uptake of nucleosides and nucleobases across the plasma membrane, mostly for salvage purposes. The canonical NTs belong to two gene families, SLC29 and SLC28. The former encode equilibrative nucleoside transporter proteins (ENTs), which mediate the facilitative diffusion of natural nucleosides with broad selectivity, whereas the latter encode concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNTs), which are sodium-coupled and show high affinity for substrates with variable selectivity. These proteins are expressed in most cell types, exhibiting apparent functional redundancy. This might indicate that CNTs have specific roles in the physiology of the cell beyond nucleoside salvage. Here, we addressed this possibility using adenoviral vectors to restore tumor cell expression of hCNT1 or a polymorphic variant (hCNT1S546P) lacking nucleoside translocation ability. We found that hCNT1 restoration in pancreatic cancer cells significantly altered cell-cycle progression and phosphorylation status of key signal-transducing kinases, promoted poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase hyperactivation and cell death and reduced cell migration. Importantly, the translocation-defective transporter triggered these same effects on cell physiology. Moreover, this study also shows that restoration of hCNT1 expression is able to reduce tumor growth in a mouse model of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These data predict a novel role for a NT protein, hCNT1, which appears to be independent of its role as mediator of nucleoside uptake by cells. Thereby, hCNT1 fits the profile of a transceptor in a substrate translocation-independent manner and is likely to be relevant to tumor biology.},

	Abstract = {Nucleoside analogues used in cancer and anti-viral therapies interfere with nucleotide metabolism and DNA replication, thus inducing their pharmacological effects. A long-awaited goal in the understanding of the pharmacological properties of these molecules, that is the molecular characterization of nucleoside plasma-membrane transporters, has been achieved very recently. These carrier proteins are encoded by at least two gene families and new isoforms remain to be identified. Direct demonstration of translocation of these drugs by nucleoside transporters has already been provided and most of them can inhibit natural nucleoside transport, probably in a competitive manner. The expression of these genes is clearly tissue-specific and might depend on the differentiated status of a cell. This is relevant because the sensitivity of a cell to a drug can depend on the type of nucleoside carrier expressed, and the drug itself might modulate nucleoside carrier expression. In this article, Marcal Pastor-Anglada, Antonio Felipe and Javier Casado discuss recent studies on the regulation of nucleoside carrier expression and of the molecular determinants of substrate specificity. Better knowledge of these will contribute to an improved design of therapies based on nucleoside derivatives. Copyright (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Human concentrative nucleoside transporter-3 (hCNT3) is a sodium-coupled nucleoside transporter that exhibits high affinity and broad substrate selectivity, making it the most suitable candidate for mediating the uptake and cytotoxic action of most nucleoside-derived drugs. The drug of this class most commonly used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the pro-apoptotic nucleoside analog fludarabine (Flu), which enters CLL cells primarily through human equilibrative nucleoside transporters (hENTs). Although CLL cells lack hCNT3 activity, they do express this transporter protein, which is located mostly in the cytosol. The aim of our study was to identify agents and mechanisms capable of promoting hCNT3 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Here, we report that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), currently used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), increases hCNT3-related activity through a mechanism that involves trafficking of pre-existing hCNT3 proteins to the plasma membrane. This effect is mediated by the autocrine action of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, which is transcriptionally activated by ATRA in a p38-dependent manner. TGF-beta1 acts through activation of ERK1/2 and the small GTPase RhoA to promote plasma membrane trafficking of the hCNT3 protein.},

Despite a huge individual variability in the mRNA amounts for every transporter gene expressed in CLL cells (CNT2, CNT3, ENT1, and ENT2), no relationship between mRNA levels and in vitro fludarabine cytotoxicity was observed. Fludarabine accumulation in CLL cells was mostly, if not exclusively, mediated by ENT-type transporters whose biologic activity was clearly correlated with fludarabine cytotoxicity, which reveals a role of ENT-mediated uptake in drug responsiveness in patients with CLL.},

Generally, this reaction has solely been attributed to the cytosolic isoform of PEPCK (PEPCK-C), although loss of the mitochondrial isoform (PEPCK-M) has never been assessed. Despite catalyzing the same reaction, to date the only significant role reported in mammals for the mitochondrial isoform is as a glucose sensor necessary for insulin secretion. We hypothesized that this nutrient-sensing mitochondrial GTP-dependent pathway contributes importantly to gluconeogenesis. PEPCK-M was acutely silenced in gluconeogenic tissues of rats using antisense oligonucleotides both in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes. Silencing PEPCK-M lowers plasma glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, reduces white adipose, and depletes hepatic glycogen, but raises lactate. There is a switch of gluconeogenic substrate preference to glycerol that quantitatively accounts for a third of glucose production. In contrast to the severe mitochondrial deficiency characteristic of PEPCK-C knock-out livers, hepatocytes from PEPCK-M-deficient livers maintained normal oxidative function. Consistent with its predicted role, gluconeogenesis rates from hepatocytes lacking PEPCK-M are severely reduced for lactate, alanine, and glutamine, but not for pyruvate and glycerol. Thus, PEPCK-M has a direct role in fasted and fed glucose homeostasis, and this mitochondrial GTP-dependent pathway should be reconsidered for its involvement in both normal and diabetic metabolism. },

	Abstract = {Folates play a key role in one-carbon metabolism essential for the biosynthesis of purines, thymidylate and hence DNA replication. The antifolate methotrexate has been rationally-designed nearly 60 years ago to potently block the folate-dependent enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) thereby achieving temporary remissions in childhood acute leukemia. Recently, the novel antifolates raltitrexed and pemetrexed that target thymidylate synthase (TS) and glycineamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF) were introduced for the treatment of colorectal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. (Anti)folates are divalent anions which predominantly use the reduced folate carrier (RFC) for their cellular uptake. (Anti)folates are retained intracellularly via polyglutamylation catalyzed by folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). As the intracellular concentration of antifolates is critical for their pharmacologic activity, polyglutamylation is a key determinant of antifolate cytotoxicity. However, anticancer drug resistance phenomena pose major obstacles towards curative cancer chemotherapy. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have identified a plethora of mechanisms of antifolate-resistance; these are frequently associated with qualitative and/or quantitative alterations in influx and/or efflux transporters of (anti)folates as well as in folate-dependent enzymes. These include inactivating mutations and/or down-regulation of the RFC and various alterations in the target enzymes DHFR, TS and FPGS. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily including multidrug resistance proteins (MRP/ABCC) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) are low affinity, high capacity ATP-driven (anti)folate efflux transporters. This transport activity is in addition to their established facility to extrude multiple cytotoxic agents. Hence, by actively extruding antifolates, overexpressed MRPs and/or BCRP confer antifolate resistance. Moreover, down-regulation of MRPs and/or BCRP results in decreased folate efflux thereby leading to expansion of the intracellular folate pool and antifolate resistance. This chapter reviews and discusses the panoply of molecular modalities of antifolate-resistance in pre-clinical tumor cell systems in vitro and in vivo as well as in cancer patients. Currently emerging novel strategies for the overcoming of antifolate-resistance are presented. Finally, experimental evidence is provided that the identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms of antifolate-resistance may prove instrumental in the future development of rationally-based novel antifolates and strategies that could conceivably overcome drug-resistance phenomena.},

@article{Nakielny1991,
	Abstract = {Improved methodology was used to establish that the phosphorylation of a serine located 10 residues from the N-terminus of glycogen synthase (N10) increases from 0.12 mol.mol-1 to 0.54 mol.mol-1 in vivo in response to adrenalin. The only 'N10 kinase' detected in muscle extracts was casein kinase-1 (CK1), although its activity was unaffected by injection of adrenalin in vivo or by incubation with cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase and MgATP in vitro. Prior phosphorylation of the serine residue N7 by phosphorylase kinase increased sixfold the rate of phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by CK1, and altered the specificity of CK1 so that it phosphorylated the serine residue N10 specifically. Stoichiometric phosphorylation of N7 decreased the activity ratio (+/- glucose 6-phosphate) of glycogen synthase from 0.80 to 0.45, and subsequent phosphorylation of N10 to 0.8 mol.mol-1 produced a further decrease to 0.17, demonstrating that N10 phosphorylation inhibits glycogen synthase. The major 'N10 phosphatase' in skeletal muscle extracts was identified as the glycogen-associated form of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1G), accounting for approximately 75{\%} of the N10 phosphatase activity in the extracts and about 90{\%} of the activity in isolated glycogen particles. Phosphorylation of N10, after prior phosphorylation of N7, decreased the rate of dephosphorylation of N7. These results, in conjunction with previous findings, establish that adrenalin inhibits glycogen synthase by increasing the phosphorylation of N7, N10 and three further serines located 30, 34 and 38 residues from the start of the C-terminal CNBr peptide (termed the region C30-C38). They also indicate that increased phosphorylation of N10, the region C30-C38, and perhaps N7, is initiated through the inhibition of PP1G by adrenalin, which results from phosphorylation of its glycogen-targetting subunit by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase [Hubbard, M.J. {\&} Cohen, P. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 186, 711-716]. The conclusion that direct phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase makes little contribution to inhibition by adrenalin, is at variance with the teachings of the major textbooks of biochemistry.},

@article{Pastor-Anglada2015,
	Abstract = {Nucleoside and nucleobase analogs are currently used in the treatment of solid tumors, lymphoproliferative diseases, viral infections such as hepatitis and AIDS, and some inflammatory diseases such as Crohn. Two gene families are implicated in the uptake of nucleosides and nucleoside analogs into cells, SCL28 and SLC29. The former encodes hCNT1, hCNT2, and hCNT3 proteins. They translocate nucleosides in a Na(+) coupled manner with high affinity and some substrate selectivity, being hCNT1 and hCNT2 pyrimidine- and purine-preferring, respectively, and hCNT3 a broad selectivity transporter. SLC29 genes encode four members, being hENT1 and hENT2 the only two which are unequivocally implicated in the translocation of nucleosides and nucleobases (the latter mostly via hENT2) at the cell plasma membrane. Some nucleoside-derived drugs can also interact with and be translocated by members of the SLC22 gene family, particularly hOCT and hOAT proteins. Inter-individual differences in transporter function and perhaps, more importantly, altered expression associated with the disease itself might modulate the transporter profile of target cells, thereby determining drug bioavailability and action. Drug transporter pharmacology has been periodically reviewed. Thus, with this contribution we aim at providing a state-of-the-art overview of the clinical evidence generated so far supporting the concept that these membrane proteins can indeed be biomarkers suitable for diagnosis and/or prognosis. Last but not least, some of these transporter proteins can also be envisaged as drug targets, as long as they can show "transceptor" functions, in some cases related to their role as modulators of extracellular adenosine levels, thereby providing a functional link between P1 receptors and transporters.},

We evaluated the effect of CR on risk factors for atherosclerosis in individuals who are restricting food intake to slow aging. We studied 18 individuals who had been on CR for an average of 6 years and 18 age-matched healthy individuals on typical American diets. We measured serum lipids and lipoproteins, fasting plasma glucose and insulin, blood pressure (BP), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet-derived growth factor AB (PDGF-AB), body composition, and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT). The CR group were leaner than the comparison group (body mass index, 19.6 +/- 1.9 vs. 25.9 +/- 3.2 kg/m(2); percent body fat, 8.7 +/- 7{\%} vs. 24 +/- 8{\%}). Serum total cholesterol (Tchol), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ratio of Tchol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, CRP, PDFG-AB, and systolic and diastolic BP were all markedly lower, whereas HDL-C was higher, in the CR than in the American diet group. Medical records indicated that the CR group had serum lipid-lipoprotein and BP levels in the usual range for individuals on typical American diets, and similar to those of the comparison group, before they began CR. Carotid artery IMT was approximately 40{\%} less in the CR group than in the comparison group. Based on a range of risk factors, it appears that long-term CR has a powerful protective effect against atherosclerosis. This interpretation is supported by the finding of a low carotid artery IMT.},

Recent findings indicate that meal timing is crucial, with both intermittent fasting and adjusted diurnal rhythm of feeding improving health and function, in the absence of changes in overall intake. Lowered intake of particular nutrients rather than of overall calories is also key, with protein and specific amino acids playing prominent roles. Nutritional modulation of the microbiome can also be important, and there are long-term, including inter-generational, effects of diet. The metabolic, molecular, and cellular mechanisms that mediate both improvement in health during aging to diet and genetic variation in the response to diet are being identified.

The transporter regulator RS1, which was initially identified as a short-term, post-transcriptional regulator of the high-affinity, Na(+)-coupled, glucose transporter sodium-dependent glucose cotransporter 1, was evaluated in this study as a candidate for coordinate regulation of membrane insertion of human CNT-type proteins. With a combination of studies with mammalian cells, Xenopus laevis oocytes, and RS1-null mice, evidence that RS1 down-regulates the localization and activity at the plasma membrane of the three members of this protein family (CNT1, CNT2, and CNT3) is provided, which indicates the biochemical basis for coordinate regulation of nucleoside uptake ability in epithelia and probably in other RS1-expressing cell types.},

Indeed, lipid-modifying drugs - in particular, the statins, which primarily lower plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol - considerably reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, leading to their widespread use. Nevertheless, it seems that there might be limits to the degree of benefit that can be achieved by lowering LDL-cholesterol levels alone, which has led to increased interest in targeting other lipid-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In this article, we first consider the mechanisms that underlie the protective effect of HDL cholesterol, and then discuss several strategies that have recently emerged to increase levels of HDL cholesterol to treat cardiovascular disease, including nuclear receptor modulation, inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and infusion of apolipoprotein/phospholipid complexes.},

	Abstract = {The site-2 protease (S2P) is an unusually-hydrophobic integral membrane protease. It cleaves its substrates, which are membrane-bound transcription factors, within membrane-spanning helices. Although structural information for S2P from animals is lacking, the available data suggest that cleavage may occur at or within the lipid bilayer. In mammalian cells, S2P is essential owing to its activation of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs); in the absence of exogenous lipid, cells lacking S2P cannot survive. S2P is also important in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, activating several different membrane-bound transcription factors. Human patients harboring reduction-of-function mutations in S2P exhibit an array of pathologies ranging from skin defects to neurological abnormalities. Surprisingly, Drosophila melanogaster lacking S2P are viable and fertile. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Intramembrane Proteases. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) function as transcription factors that activate specific genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, endocytosis of low density lipoproteins, the synthesis of both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and glucose metabolism. As such, these proteins provide a link between lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. There are three SREBPs, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2, that are encoded by two genes. SREBPs are synthesized as 125 kDa precursor proteins that are localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. The precursor is transported to the Golgi by a chaperone protein (SREBP-cleavage activating protein) and then cleaved by two proteases to release the mature, transcriptionally active 68 kDa amino terminal domain. Recent studies have shown that formation of mature SREBP is controlled at multiple levels in response to changes in the levels of oxysterols, insulin/glucose and polyunsaturated fatty acids. These recent findings have important clinical implications relevant to hyperlipidemia and diabetes and are the topic of this review. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Within a cell, how cholesterol is transported and how its heterogeneous distribution is maintained are poorly understood. Recent advances have identified novel pathways and regulators of cholesterol trafficking. Sterol transfer by lipid-binding proteins, such as OSBP (oxysterol-binding protein), coupled with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate exchange at membrane contact sites (MCSs) has emerged as a new theme of cholesterol transport between organellar membranes. Moreover, a previously unappreciated role of peroxisomes in cholesterol trafficking has been revealed recently. These discoveries highlight the crucial role of MCSs, or junctions, in facilitating lipid movement, and provide mechanistic insights into how cholesterol is sorted in cells.},

	Abstract = {The human concentrative nucleoside transporter-3 C602R (hCNT3C602R), a recently identified human concentrative nucleoside transporter-3 (hCNT3) variant, has been shown to interact with natural nucleosides with apparent K(m) values similar to those of the wild-type transporter, although binding of one of the two sodium ions required for nucleoside translocation is impaired, resulting in decreased V(max) values (Mol Pharmacol 73:379-386, 2008). We have further analyzed the properties of this hCNT3 variant by determining its localization in plasma membrane lipid domains and its interaction with nucleoside-derived drugs used in anticancer and antiviral therapies. When expressed heterologously in HeLa cells, wild-type hCNT3 localized to both lipid raft and nonlipid raft domains. Treatment of cells with the cholesterol-depleting agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin resulted in a marked decrease in hCNT3-related transport activity that was associated with the loss of wild-type hCNT3 from lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that although exogenously expressed hCNT3C602R was present in nonlipid raft domains at a level similar to that of the wild-type transporter, the mutant transporter was present at much lower amounts in lipid rafts. A substrate profile analysis showed that interactions with a variety of nucleoside-derived drugs were altered in the hCNT3C602R variant and revealed that sugar hydroxyl residues are key structural determinants for substrate recognition by the hCNT3C602R variant.},

	Abstract = {The urinary excretion of orotic acid, an intermediate in the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway, is markedly increased in many inborn errors of the urea cycle and in a number of other disorders involving arginine metabolism. Carbamoyl phosphate, which accumulates within hepatic mitochondria in patients with ornithine transcarbamoylase deficiency, can diffuse to the cytosol and enter the pyrimidine pathway, resulting in greatly increased orotic acid production and excretion. This orotic aciduria also occurs in inborn errors of the mitochondrial ornithine/citrulline transporter, arginase, argininosuccinate synthetase, and argininosuccinate lyase. Increased orotic acid excretion is also found in a number of hypoargininemic states, such as lysinuric protein intolerance. However, orotic aciduria should not be used uncritically as an index of arginine deficiency because it is found in patients with arginase deficiency who exhibit hyperargininemia. Increased orotic acid excretion can also arise as a result of impairments of pyrimidine synthesis, whether brought about by a genetic defect (e.g., in UMP synthase) or by drugs that inhibit the terminal part of the pathway (e.g., allopurinol or 6-azauridine). When used appropriately, measurement of urinary orotic acid is a valuable tool for the study of many derangements of arginine metabolism, including arginine depletion, and to assess the efficacy of therapies used to replete this amino acid.},

	Abstract = {The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha is a ligand-activated transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. PPARalpha mediates the effects of fibrates, which are potent hypolipidemic drugs, on gene expression. To better understand the biological effects of fibrates and PPARalpha, we searched for genes regulated by PPARalpha using oligonucleotide microarray and subtractive hybridization. By comparing liver RNA from wild-type and PPARalpha null mice, it was found that PPARalpha decreases the mRNA expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids. Further analysis by Northern blot revealed that PPARalpha influences the expression of several genes involved in trans- and deamination of amino acids, and urea synthesis. Direct activation of PPARalpha using the synthetic PPARalpha ligand WY14643 decreased mRNA levels of these genes, suggesting that PPARalpha is directly implicated in the regulation of their expression. Consistent with these data, plasma urea concentrations are modulated by PPARalpha in vivo. It is concluded that in addition to oxidation of fatty acids, PPARalpha also regulates metabolism of amino acids in liver, indicating that PPARalpha is a key controller of intermediary metabolism during fasting},

In contrast, even the fundamental physiologic workings of mechanosensitive systems are still poorly understood, but rapid recent progress is beginning to shed light.

Recently, it has been recognized that thyroid hormone receptor interacts with transcription factors that predominantly respond to nutrient signals including the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, liver X receptor and others. Crosstalk between thyroid hormone signaling and these nutrient responsive factors occurs through a variety of mechanisms: competition for retinoid X receptor heterodimer partners, DNA binding sites and transcriptional cofactors. This review focuses on the mechanisms of interaction of thyroid hormone signaling with other metabolic pathways and the importance of understanding these interactions to develop therapeutic agents for treatment of metabolic disorders, such as dyslipidemias, obesity and diabetes.},

They bind to thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), TRalpha and TRbeta, which belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. These receptors also bind to enhancer elements in the promoters of target genes, and can regulate both positive and negative transcription. Recent emerging evidence has characterized some of the molecular mechanisms by which THs regulate transcription as co-repressors, and co-activators have been identified and their effects on histone acetylation examined. THs also have rapid effects that do not require transcription. These can occur via TRs or other cellular proteins, and typically occur outside the nucleus. It appears that THs regulate multiple cellular functions using a diverse array of receptors and signaling systems. TR isoform- or pathway-specific drugs might provide the therapeutic benefits of TH action such as decreasing obesity or lowering cholesterol levels without some of the side effects of hyperthyroidism.},

The triacylglycerol produced at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is either incorporated into prechylomicrons within the ER lumen or shunted to triacylglycerol storage pools. The prechylomicrons exit the ER in a specialized transport vesicle in the rate-limiting step in the intracellular transit of triacylglycerol across the enterocyte. The prechylomicrons are further processed in the Golgi and are transported to the basolateral membrane via a separate vesicular system for exocytosis into the intestinal lamina propria. Fatty acids and monoacylglycerols entering the enterocyte via the basolateral membrane are also incorporated into triacylglycerol, but the basolaterally entering lipid is much more likely to enter the triacylglycerol storage pool than the lipid entering via the apical membrane.},

@article{Eberle2004,
	Abstract = {Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) are a family of transcription factors that regulate lipid homeostasis by controlling the expression of a range of enzymes required for endogenous cholesterol, fatty acid (FA), triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. The three SREBP isoforms, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c and SREBP-2, have different roles in lipid synthesis. In vivo studies using transgenic and knockout mice suggest that SREBP-1c is involved in FA synthesis and insulin induced glucose metabolism (particularly in lipogenesis), whereas SREBP-2 is relatively specific to cholesterol synthesis. The SREBP-1a isoform seems to be implicated in both pathways. SREBP transcription factors are synthetized as inactive precursors bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Upon activation, the precursor undergoes a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the NH 2-terminal active domain in the nucleus (designated nSREBPs). SREBP processing is mainly controlled by cellular sterol content. When sterol levels decrease, the precursor is cleaved to activate cholesterogenic genes and maintain cholesterol homeostasis. This sterol-sensitive process appears to be a major point of regulation for the SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 isoforms but not for SREBP-1c. Moreover, the SREBP-1c isoform seems to be mainly regulated at the transcriptional level by insulin. The unique regulation and activation properties of each SREBP isoform facilitate the co-ordinate regulation of lipid metabolism; however, further studies are needed to understand the detailed regulation pathways that specifically regulate each SREBP isoform. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier SAS.

@article{Yeaman2004,
	Abstract = {Although described initially as an intracellular adipocyte-specific triacylglycerol lipase, it is now clear that HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) is expressed in multiple tissues and plays a number of roles in lipid metabolism, including that of a neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase. The major isoform is a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of approx. 84 kDa and which comprises three major domains: a catalytic domain, a regulatory domain encoding several phosphorylation sites and an N-terminal domain involved in protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. The activity of HSL is regulated acutely by several mechanisms, including reversible phosphorylation by a number of different protein kinases, translocation to different sites within the cell and interaction with a number of proteins, some of which may serve to direct the inhibitory products of HSL away from the protein. It is also apparent from work with HSL null mice that more than one enzyme species may be classified as a hormone-sensitive lipase. The possible presence of HSL in macrophages remains controversial, and the role of the protein in pancreatic beta-cells has yet to be fully elucidated. Altered expression of HSL in different cell types may be associated with a number of pathological states, including obesity, atherosclerosis and Type II diabetes.},

@article{Tornheim1985,
	Abstract = {Fructose-2,6-P2 and fructose-1,6-P2 are strong activators of muscle phosphofructokinase. They have been shown to be competitive in binding studies, and it is generally thought that they affect the physical and catalytic properties of the enzyme in the same manner. However, there are indications in published data that the effects of the two fructose bisphosphates on phosphofructokinase are not identical. To examine this possibility, the kinetics of activation of rat skeletal muscle phosphofructokinase by the two fructose bisphosphates were compared in the presence of other regulatory metabolites. Citrate greatly increased the K0.5 of the enzyme for fructose-2,6-P2, with little effect on the maximum activation. In contrast, citrate greatly decreased the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2, with only a small effect on the K0.5. Changes in the concentrations of the inhibitor ATP or the activator AMP similarly altered the K0.5 for fructose-2,6-P2, but altered the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2. Finally, when fructose-1,6-P2 was added in the presence of a given concentration of fructose-2,6-P2, phosphofructokinase activity was decreased if the activation by fructose-2,6-P2 alone was greater than the maximum activation by fructose-1,6-P2 alone. These results are consistent with competition of the two fructose bisphosphates for the same binding site, but indicate that the conformational changes produced by their binding are different.},

@article{VanderHeiden2009,
	Abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},
