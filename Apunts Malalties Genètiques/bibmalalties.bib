	Abstract = {Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of cognitive deficiency in humans and perhaps the best-understood single cause of autism. A trinucleotide repeat expansion, inactivating the X-linked FMR1 gene, leads to the absence of the fragile X mental retardation protein. FMRP is a selective RNA-binding protein that regulates the local translation of a subset of mRNAs at synapses in response to activation of Gp1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and possibly other receptors. In the absence of FMRP, excess and dysregulated mRNA translation leads to altered synaptic function and loss of protein synthesis-dependent plasticity. Recent evidence indicates the role of FMRP in regulated mRNA transport in dendrites. New studies also suggest a possible local function of FMRP in axons that may be important for guidance, synaptic development, and formation of neural circuits. The understanding of FMRP function at synapses has led to rationale therapeutic approaches. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Santoro2012,
	Abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of inherited intellectual disability and is one of the leading known causes of autism. The mutation responsible for FXS is a large expansion of the trinucleotide CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated region of the X-linked gene FMR1. This expansion leads to DNA methylation of FMR1 and to transcriptional silencing, which results in the absence of the gene product, FMRP, a selective messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein that regulates the translation of a subset of dendritic mRNAs. FMRP is critical for mGluR (metabotropic glutamate receptor)-dependent long-term depression, as well as for other forms of synaptic plasticity; its absence causes excessive and persistent protein synthesis in postsynaptic dendrites and dysregulated synaptic function. Studies continue to refine our understanding of FMRP's role in synaptic plasticity and to uncover new functions of this protein, which have illuminated therapeutic approaches for FXS.},

@article{Plante-Bordeneuve2011,
	Abstract = {Familial amyloid polyneuropathies (FAPs) are a group of life-threatening multisystem disorders transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Nerve lesions are induced by deposits of amyloid fibrils, most commonly due to mutated transthyretin (TTR). Less often the precursor of amyloidosis is mutant apolipoprotein A-1 or gelsolin. The first identified cause of FAP-the TTR Val30Met mutation-is still the most common of more than 100 amyloidogenic point mutations identified worldwide. The penetrance and age at onset of FAP among people carrying the same mutation vary between countries. The symptomatology and clinical course of FAP can be highly variable. TTR FAP typically causes a nerve length-dependent polyneuropathy that starts in the feet with loss of temperature and pain sensations, along with life-threatening autonomic dysfunction leading to cachexia and death within 10 years on average. TTR is synthesised mainly in the liver, and liver transplantation seems to have a favourable effect on the course of neuropathy, but not on cardiac or eye lesions. Oral administration of tafamidis meglumine, which prevents misfolding and deposition of mutated TTR, is under evaluation in patients with TTR FAP. In future, patients with FAP might benefit from gene therapy; however, genetic counselling is recommended for the prevention of all types of FAP. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Blake, Derek J., Andrew Weir, Sarah E. Newey, and Kay E. Davies. Function and Genetics of Dystrophin and Dystrophin-Related Proteins in Muscle. Physiol. Rev. 82: 291-329, 2002.[IMG]The X-linked muscle-wasting disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin. There is currently no effective treatment for the disease; however, the complex molecular pathology of this disorder is now being unravelled. Dystrophin is located at the muscle sarcolemma in a membrane-spanning protein complex that connects the cytoskeleton to the basal lamina. Mutations in many components of the dystrophin protein complex cause other forms of autosomally inherited muscular dystrophy, indicating the importance of this complex in normal muscle function. Although the precise function of dystrophin is unknown, the lack of protein causes membrane destabilization and the activation of multiple pathophysiological processes, many of which converge on alterations in intracellular calcium handling. Dystrophin is also the prototype of a family of dystrophin-related proteins, many of which are found in muscle. This family includes utrophin and [alpha]-dystrobrevin, which are involved in the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction architecture and in muscle homeostasis. New insights into the pathophysiology of dystrophic muscle, the identification of compensating proteins, and the discovery of new binding partners are paving the way for novel therapeutic strategies to treat this fatal muscle disease. This review discusses the role of the dystrophin complex and protein family in muscle and describes the physiological processes that are affected in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.},

@article{Tyfield2000,
	Abstract = {More than 160 different base changes have been described at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase gene and most of these are associated with a disease phenotype. Q188R is the most common mutation in north European populations and those predominantly of European descent. K285N is much rarer but in some countries of east/central Europe it is the second most common mutation. In some populations of northern Europe these two mutations can be found on 70{\%}-80{\%} of mutant chromosomes. Both mutations appear to be associated with a complete loss in enzyme activity and thus, a more severe biochemical phenotype. A single amino acid substitution, N314D, is found on both Duarte 1 and Duarte 2 alleles. Additional base changes that are different on each distinguish D1 from D2 alleles. Whether the differences in galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase enzyme activities are associated with the additional molecular changes that distinguish D1 and D2 alleles remains unclear. S135L is found almost exclusively in galactosaemic individuals of African origin. Despite early diagnosis and treatment and adherence to a lactose free diet neurological complications, poor growth and reduced fertility are frequently observed in affected individuals. CONCLUSION: Allelic variation at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase gene undoubtedly plays a role in defining the biochemical and clinical phenotype. However, clinical galactosaemia is a complex trait in which multiple developmental and metabolic pathways are involved. Ultimately the phenotype is beyond the control of the single gene itself.},

	Abstract = {Citrullinemia type 1 (CTLN1) is an autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by a deficiency of argininosuccinate synthetase. Despite optimal management, CTLN1 patients still suffer from lethal metabolic instability and experience life-threatening episodes of acute hyperammonemia. A murine model of CTLN1 (fold/fold) that displays lethality within the first 21 days of life was used to determine the efficacy of adeno-associated viral (AAV) gene transfer as a potential therapy. An AAV serotype 8 (AAV8) vector was engineered to express the human ASS1 cDNA under the control of a liver-specific promoter (thyroxine-binding globulin, TBG), AAV8-TBG-hASS1, and delivered to 7-10 days old mice via intraperitoneal injection. Greater than 95{\%} of the mice were rescued from lethality and survival was extended beyond 100 days after receiving a single dose of vector. AAV8-TBG-hASS1 treatment resulted in liver-specific expression of hASS1, increased ASS1 enzyme activity, reduction in plasma ammonia and citrulline concentrations and significant phenotypic improvement of the fold/fold growth and skin phenotypes. These experiments highlight a gene transfer approach using AAV8 vector for liver-targeted gene therapy that could serve as a treatment for CTLN1.},

@article{Forest2004,
	Abstract = {Congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH) are inherited defects of cortisol biosynthesis. More than 90{\%} of CAH are caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD), found in 1:10 000 to 1:15 000 live births. Females with 'classical' 21-OHD, being exposed to excess androgens prenatally, are born with virilized external genitalia. Potentially lethal adrenal insufficiency is characteristic of two-thirds to three-quarters of patients with the classical salt wasting (SW) form of 21-OHD. Non-SW 21-OHD may be diagnosed on genital ambiguity in affected females, and/or later on the occurrence of androgen excess in both sexes. Non-classical 21-OHD, detected in {\textgreater} or =1:100 of certain populations, may present as precocious pubarche in children or polycystic ovarian syndrome in young women. 21-OHD is caused by mutations in the CYP21 gene encoding the steroid 21-hydroxylase enzyme. More than 90{\%} of these mutations result from intergenic recombination between CYP21 and the closely linked CYP21P pseudogene. The degree to which each mutation compromises enzymatic activity is strongly correlated with the clinical severity of the disorder. This close association between genotype and phenotype makes it possible to predict clinical outcome in affected subjects. The risk of SW and prenatal virilization can be estimated, and overtreatment can be avoided in mildly affected cases. Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapies are the mainstays of treatment, but additional therapies are being developed. A first trimester prenatal diagnosis should be proposed in families in whom molecular studies have been performed previously. The state of heterozygotism can be predicted by hormonal testing and confirmed by molecular studies. Prenatal diagnosis by direct mutation detection in previously genotyped families permits prenatal treatment of affected females in order to avoid or minimize genital virilization. Neonatal screening by hormonal methods identifies affected children before SW crises develop, reducing mortality in this disorder.},

	Abstract = {Citrullinemia type I (CTLN1, OMIM{\#} 215700) is an inherited urea cycle disorder that is caused by an argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) enzyme deficiency. In this report, we describe two spontaneous hypomorphic alleles of the mouse Ass1 gene that serve as an animal model of CTLN1. These two independent mouse mutant alleles, also described in patients affected with CTLN1, interact to produce a range of phenotypes. While some mutant mice died within the first week after birth, others survived but showed severe retardation during postnatal development as well as alopecia, lethargy, and ataxia. Notable pathological findings were similar to findings in human CTLN1 patients and included citrullinemia and hyperammonemia along with delayed cerebellar development, epidermal hyperkeratosis, and follicular dystrophy. Standard treatments for CTLN1 were effective in rescuing the phenotype of these mutant mice. Based on our studies, we propose that defective cerebellar granule cell migration secondary to disorganization of Bergmann glial cell fibers cause cerebellar developmental delay in the hyperammonemic and citrullinemic brain, pointing to a possible role for nitric oxide in these processes. These mouse mutations constitute a suitable model for both mechanistic and preclinical studies of CTLN1 and other hyperammonemic encephalopathies and, at the same time, underscore the importance of complementing knockout mutations with hypomorphic mutations for the generation of animal models of human genetic diseases.},

	Abstract = {Studies of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay in mammalian cells have proffered unforeseen insights into changes in mRNA-protein interactions throughout the lifetime of an mRNA. Remarkably, mRNA acquires a complex of proteins at each exon-exon junction during pre-mRNA splicing that influences the subsequent steps of mRNA translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Complex-loaded mRNA is thought to undergo a pioneer round of translation when still bound by cap-binding proteins CBP80 and CBP20 and poly(A)-binding protein 2. The acquisition and loss of mRNA-associated proteins accompanies the transition from the pioneer round to subsequent rounds of translation, and from translational competence to substrate for nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.},

	Abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a quality-control mechanism that selectively degrades mRNAs harboring premature termination (nonsense) codons. If translated, these mRNAs can produce truncated proteins with dominant-negative or deleterious gain-of-function activities. In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism of NMD. We first cover conserved factors known to be involved in NMD in all eukaryotes. We then describe a unique protein complex that is deposited on mammalian mRNAs during splicing, which defines a stop codon as premature. Interaction between this exon-junction complex (EJC) and NMD factors assembled at the upstream stop codon triggers a series of steps that ultimately lead to mRNA decay. We discuss whether these proofreading events preferentially occur during a "pioneer" round of translation in higher and lower eukaryotes, their cellular location, and whether they can use alternative EJC factors or act independent of the EJC.},

	Abstract = {Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by overgrowth, tumor predisposition, and congenital malformations. Approximately 85{\%} of reported BWS cases are sporadic, while the remaining 15{\%} are familial. BWS is caused by epigenetic or genomic alterations which disrupt genes in one or both of the two imprinted domains on chromosome 11p15.5. In each domain, an imprinting center regulates the expression of imprinted genes in cis. Normally in domain 1, insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the untranslated mRNA H19 are monoallelically expressed. In BWS, increased expression of IGF2 occurs via several mechanisms. In domain 2, CDKN1C, a growth repressor, and an untranslated RNA, KCNQ1OT1, are normally expressed monoallelically. In cases of BWS, several mechanisms result in reduced expression of CDKN1C. Recent reports of BWS cases have identified mutations outside the chromosome 11p15.5 critical region, thereby broadening the challenges in the diagnosis and genetic counseling of individuals and families with BWS.},

	Abstract = {Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are clinically distinct complex disorders mapped to chromosome 15q11-q13. They both have characteristic neurologic, developmental, and behavioral phe-notypes plus other structural and functional abnormalities. However, the cognitive and neurologic impair-ment is more severe in AS, including seizures and ataxia. The behavioral and endocrine disorders are more severe in PWS, including obsessive?compulsive symptoms and hypothalamic insufficiency. Both disorders can result from microdeletion, uniparental disomy, or an imprinting center defect in 15q11-q13, although the abnormality is on the paternally derived chromosome 15 for PWS and the maternally derived 15 for AS because of genomic imprinting. Although the same gene may control imprinting for both disorders, the gene(s) causing their phenotypes differ. AS results from underexpression of a single gene, UBE3A, which codes for E6-AP, a protein that functions to transfer small ubiquitin molecules to certain target proteins, to enable their degradation. The genes responsible for PWS are not determined, although several mater-nally imprinted genes in 15q11-q13 are known. The most likely candidate is SNRPN, which codes for a small nuclear ribonucleoprotein, a ribosome-associated protein that controls gene splicing and thus synthesis of critical proteins in the brain. Animal models exist for both disorders. The genetic relationship between PWS and AS makes them unique and potentially highly instructive disorders that contribute substantially to the population burden of cognitive impairment. Am.},

DNA methylation is also involved in X-chromosome inactivation and the allele-specific silencing of imprinted genes. This review describes possible mechanisms by which DNA methylation can regulate gene expression, using imprinted genes as examples. The molecular basis of methylation-mediated gene regulation is related to changes in chromatin structure and appears to be similar for both imprinted and biallelically expressed genes.},

	Abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in regulatory regions of candidate genes may determine variability in bone mineral density (BMD) because they may be responsible for differences in levels of a gene product in response to external signals. Under this hypothesis, we scanned an 800-base pair (bp) region within the COL1A1 promoter, known to harbor cis elements important for in vivo expression, and we found two new polymorphisms: -1663indelT and -1997 G/T. The G to T transversion at -1997 was associated with lumbar spine BMD (p = 0.015) when tested in a cohort of 256 postmenopausal women after adjusting by age, body weight, and years since menopause; a lower degree of association was detected also for femoral neck BMD in a subgroup of 146 women in univariate analysis and after adjusting by age (p = 0.044). The polymorphism -1663indelT, which corresponds to a deletion of a T in a tract of eight T residues (-1670 to -1663), did not show significant association with BMD. Interestingly, -1663indelT is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the previously described Sp1 polymorphism of intron 1, which in this study did not show association with BMD either. Significant interaction between -1997 G/T and -1663indelT (p = 0.019), and between -1997 G/T and Sp1 (p = 0.045) was observed also. Individuals heterozygous for the three polymorphisms showed the highest mean BMD value. Gel retardation assays showed that oligonucleotides containing either the -1663 or the -1997 polymorphic sites specifically bind primary osteoblast nuclear proteins. We named these binding sites as PCOL1 and PCOL2, respectively. In summary, this study describes two new SNPs in the COL1A1 promoter, which may affect bone mass determination.},

	Abstract = {CONTEXT: Both bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk have a strong genetic component. Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) is a candidate gene for osteoporosis, but previous studies of ESR1 polymorphisms in this field were hampered by small sample size, lack of standardization, and inconclusive results. OBJECTIVE: To generate large-scale evidence on whether 3 common ESR1 polymorphisms (intron 1 polymorphisms XbaI [dbSNP: rs9340799] and PvuII [dbSNP: rs2234693] and promoter TA repeats microsatellite) and haplotypes thereof are associated with BMD and fractures. DESIGN AND SETTING: Meta-analysis of individual-level data involving standardized genotyping of 18 917 individuals in 8 European centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BMD of femoral neck and lumbar spine; all fractures and vertebral fractures by genotype. RESULTS: No between-center heterogeneity was observed for any outcome in any genetic contrast. None of the 3 polymorphisms or haplotypes had any statistically significant effect on BMD in adjusted or unadjusted analyses, and estimated differences between genetic contrasts were 0.01 g/cm2 or less. Conversely, we found significant reductions in fracture risk. In women homozygous for the absence of an XbaI recognition site, the adjusted odds of all fractures were reduced by 19{\%} (odds ratio, 0.81 [95{\%} CI, 0.71-0.93]; P = .002) and vertebral fractures by 35{\%} (odds ratio, 0.65 [95{\%} CI, 0.49-0.87]; P = .003). Effects on fractures were independent of BMD and unaltered in adjusted analyses. No significant effects on fracture risk were seen for PvuII and TA repeats. CONCLUSIONS: ESR1 is a susceptibility gene for fractures, and XbaI determines fracture risk by mechanisms independent of BMD. Our study demonstrates the value of adequately powered studies with standardized genotyping and clinical outcomes in defining effects of common genetic variants on complex diseases.},
